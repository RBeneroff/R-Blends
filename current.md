# R-Blends - current tasks/bugs/reaches

Working on:
- put all JS in script tags into separate file
- do validations to saving cover schemes (cant submit without name and at least one colors)
- work on sticky footer


Stumped on/Would like to add:
- user doesn't persist on page refresh -- token still in localStorage, but doesn't recognize user
- if time - ng-messages: add validations to forms: (have it shaking - but tell why it failed, shake more than once if doesn't meet validation multiple times) http://demo.geekslabs.com/materialize/v3.1/form-validation.html?action= (started on settings page)
