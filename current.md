Working on:

Bugs to fix:
- make sure everything is mobile friendly (is there a show-on-small-only?)

Reaches/other feature to implement:
- add validation to saving cover schemes (cant submit without name and at least one colors)
- in Settings:
  - be able to create your own customized color scheme for the website
- if time - ng-messages: add validations to forms: (have it shaking - but tell why it failed, shake more than once if doesn't meet validation multiple times) http://demo.geekslabs.com/materialize/v3.1/form-validation.html?action= (started on settings page)
https://www.sitepoint.com/easy-form-validation-angularjs-ngmessages/

Stumped on:
- user doesn't persist on page refresh -- token still in localStorage, but doesn't recognize user
